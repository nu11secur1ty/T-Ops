## Quick start

### Install docker

If you have a Debian-Based Operating System you can use the docker.io package.
```console
apt install docker.io
```

> If you are using a docker supported OS that does not have the docker.io package, you should take a look at [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

You can also use the docker install script by running:
```console
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
```

### Runing the container

This command will pull, create, and start the container: (replace {version} with the version you want)

```console
docker pull nu11secur1ty/ovas-ops:latest
docker run --detach --publish 8080:9392 --env PASSWORD="Your admin password here" --volume gvm-data:/data --name gvm nu11secur1ty/ovas-ops:latest
# Example
# docker run --detach --publish 8080:9392 --env PASSWORD="Your admin password here" --volume gvm-data:/data --name gvm nu11secur1ty/ovas-ops:{version}
```
